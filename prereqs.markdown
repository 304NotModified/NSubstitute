A full build of NSubstitute, including document/website generation and packaging, requires the following (in addition to .NET 3.5 development tools):

* [Git](http://git-scm.com/). [Mysys git for Windows](http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/) works well. Git will need to be on your path.
* [Ruby 1.9+](http://ruby-lang.org). Using [RubyInstaller for Windows](http://rubyinstaller.org/) is probably easiest.
* [RubyInstaller DevKit](http://rubyinstaller.org/add-ons/devkit/) (see [wiki](http://github.com/oneclick/rubyinstaller/wiki/Development-Kit) for details)
* These Ruby gems: rubygems, rake, rspec, shoulda, rsubstitute, jekyll (plus their dependencies)
