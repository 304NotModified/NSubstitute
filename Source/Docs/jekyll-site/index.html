        <h2>Mock, stub, fake, double? Nah, just Substitute</h2>
        <p>NSubstitute is tailored for Arrange - Act - Assert testing. No need to worry about mocks vs. stubs, strict or loose, or property behaviour. Just substitute for the type you need!</p>

        <h2>Why another framework?</h2>
      <p>There are already some great mocking frameworks around for .NET, so why create another? We found that for all their great features, none of the existing frameworks had the succinct syntax we were craving &mdash; the code required to configure test doubles quickly obscured the intention behind our tests.</p>

	  <p>We've attempted to make the most frequently required operations obvious and easy to use, keeping less usual scenarios discoverable and accessible, and all the while maintaining as much natural language as possible.</p>

	  <p>Perfect for those new to testing, and for others who would just like to to get their tests written with less noise and less lambdas.</p>
